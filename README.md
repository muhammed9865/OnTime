# OnTime
## Goal of OnTime
If you ever get stuck on an infinite loop of scrolling social media 'content', and always miss things you had to do.
On.time got you! You can now schedule your todo's and get notified 'On.time'.
## Features
- Write down your notes so you don't have to remember everything.
- Schedule a new task with a duration
- Cool UI to visualize your notes or schedules.
- What day is today?! Don't worry a Calendar to tell you the date.
- Notifications list to tell you when exactly are your next tasks going to pop up.
